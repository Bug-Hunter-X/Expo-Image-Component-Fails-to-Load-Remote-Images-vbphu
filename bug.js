This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that points to an image hosted on a remote server.  The image fails to load, and the `Image` component either displays a broken image icon or remains blank. This often happens when the remote server is slow to respond, returns an unexpected response, or the URI is incorrect.
